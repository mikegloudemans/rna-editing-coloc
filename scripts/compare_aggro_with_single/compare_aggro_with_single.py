# Compare the colocalizations found using aggregated (by gene) edQTLs
# and single-position edQTLs

# TODO: Right now it's hard to tell whether differences are due to
# difference in method used or difference in actual power/signal.
# Try running the single-SNP analysis with COLOC so that we can
# get a nicer comparison for this part.

# Load in both coloc output files

# Match the single-position edQTLs to the relevant genes
# (just guess for now, and we'll get the true mapping from
# Qin later if needed)

# For both studies...
# Threshold at some point on what colocalizations are considered
# significant (e.g. H4 > CLPP)

# Plot comparison between the two studies and identify drastically different 
# SNPs (i.e. highly significant in one method but not in the other)

# Identify any SNPs with major differences between the two methods

# Examine a few of these sites up close
